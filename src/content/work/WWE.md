WWE relaunched it’s On Demand video service in Q2 of 2019. The app showcases live wrestling events as well as the whole past catalogue of WWE shows, Original content related to Sports Entertainment and short-form clips.

I was brought on board this project via an agency which I had previously worked with. The WWE Network is spread across Responsive Web, Mobile and TV so my previous experience was a plus point.

I worked extremely closely with the client-side through all instances of this project and took designs from concept through to support for the development of the features.

Exclusive Content

The WWE Network is a streaming service which allows users to view any available content from WWE’s 70-year history.
Subscribers can use the interface to invoke any event and any match from the library to watch on-demand as well as having live access to a 24-hour linear streaming channel showing curated popular content.

Alongside historical events, customers can also watch live exclusive WWE events as well as backstage documentaries.

When I was brought aboard the project there was a bass level of the design work completed which allowed me to expand upon a base and start to explore a more creative next step for the project.
Atomic Design System

Working alongside the Director of Experience and Design on the WWE side, we started the work of creating an atomic design system to accelerate the speed of design and increase the consistency of the overall project

The design system inherets the already established framework of the project and the specific required platform components in Android and iOS, whilst allowing more accurate definitions of typography, spacing, colour and motion

With the use of third-party tools such as Zeplin and Abstract, we harnessed the instant sharing capabilities to allow developers to quickly and easily see the specifications of the selected components whilst retaining version history.

Making Motion Matter

When looking at the project as a whole, the redesign felt very static. I wanted to bring some motion into effect and luckily the client agreed with me.

By auditing the designs we found several key areas we could start to integrate transition effects and explored with a variety.

Some concepts would cause too much development time so had to be put aside, whilst we could leverage the power of the mobile devices specifically to ensure that these used the transitions that users would be used to.

One unified experience

A clear goal from the client was to have the WWE network on multiple devices whilst retaining the same look and feel of the WWE brand across them all.
We also wanted to ensure that users could jump from one platform to the other whilst retaining their positions in the content they were watching.

We maintained this but also allowed each System to have its unique touches and user journeys to ensure that the user was familiar with the patterns.

This was especially true in both Android and iOS devices where the differences are at the system level.

Bringing the fans closer

The fans are the central focus of the WWE Network redesign and there was extensive user research into exactly what the fans wanted from the service.

One such factor that appeared was that the wrestlers themselves are one of the most intriguing pieces of the whole product. WWE decided that a section of the app should be based on the superstars themselves, giving users clear and easy access to information about their stars as well as easy access to career-defining moments and achievements.

Alongside this, we also set to work on creating journies to content such as Biographies, Champions and timelines of championships as well as extended views of the WWE Superstars careers
